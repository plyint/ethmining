## Ethereum Mining Calculator

Use this mining calculator to figure out your profitability for your mining rig(s).

You will want to plug in the following 4 values to the calculator below based on your planned setup.  You can leave the other prepopulated values as is.

* __Hashing Power__ - The total amount of compute power for your rig.  Normally measured in MH/s. <br />
(e.g. An nVidia 1070 GTX card normally gets around 26.66 MH/s, so a 6 card rig would get approximately 160 MH/s)
* __Power Usage__ - Amount of power used by the rig.  Measured in Watts(w). <br />
(e.g. A 6 GPU rig might use around 800 - 1000 Watts)
* __Power Cost__ - The rate you pay for power.  Normally measured in kw/h.  Get this from your electric bill. <br />
(e.g. Residential power might be around 0.036 kw/h)
* __Pool Fee__ - The fee charged by the mining pool you are in.  Most people mine as part of a pool, so they can get regular payouts.  <br />
(e.g. 1% fee is standard)
