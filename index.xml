      <description>Overview Once you&amp;rsquo;ve built your Ethereum mining rigs and they&amp;rsquo;ve been operational for a while, then you may desire to overclock the machines in order to boost the performance of each rig. Overclocking GPUs on Linux is a bit more involved than Windows, but it is still possible.
There are 3 main steps to overclocking your graphics cards:
 Install and configure X org Reinstall the NVIDIA driver Install a service to automatically overclock the GPUs at startup  Install and configure Xorg If you followed our previous guide to install Ubuntu Server LTS for mining Ethereum, then you will not have an X server installed on your system.</description>

      <description>Overview This guide assumes your are familiar with Ethereum and mining Ether. It will walk you through the entire process of building, assembling and installing an Ethereum mining rig running the Ubuntu Server LTS operating system using NVIDIA graphics cards.
There are 3 main steps to the process:
 Purchasing the hardware Assembling the machine Installing the OS and software  Before beginning, it&amp;rsquo;s worth noting why one might choose to run Ubuntu for the operating system rather than say ethOS or Windows.</description>

      <description>Ethereum Mining Calculator Use this mining calculator to figure out your profitability for your mining rig(s).
You will want to plug in the following 4 values to the calculator below based on your planned setup. You can leave the other prepopulated values as is.
 Hashing Power - The total amount of compute power for your rig. Normally measured in MH/s. (e.g. An nVidia 1070 GTX card normally gets around 26.</description>

      <description>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) This FAQ is not exhaustive in regards to mining Ethereum, but it does seek to provide short and direct explanations of some of the more common questions newcomers to mining might have. A good resource for further questions is the Ether Mining Subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/)
What is Ethereum? Ethereum is a proof-of-work, cryptocurrency based on the Bitcoin code base. It differs from Bitcoin by allowing generic programs (aka smart contracts) to be written and run on the Ethereum blockchain, whereas Bitcoin was designed to be primarily used for financial transactions.</description>
